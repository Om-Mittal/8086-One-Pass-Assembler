1. Place "Calculator.asm" (the ASM file) and "One-Pass-Assembler.c" (the assembler code) in the same directory.
2. Create 3 empty text files in the same directory, named "RegisterTable.txt", "Labels.txt", "ObjectCode.txt".
3. Run the assembler code. It reads the ASM file line-by-line, and writes the required output into the .txt files, as shown in the report.
